//! Primary logic and implementation details of Discord gateway websocket
//! connections.
//!
//! Shards are, at their heart, a websocket connection with some state for
//! maintaining an identified session with the Discord gateway. For more
//! information about what a shard is in the context of Discord's gateway API,
//! refer to the documentation for [`Shard`].
//!
//! # Implementation Flow
//!
//! Other than informative methods and getters, shards have two functions:
//! sending websocket messages and receiving websocket messages, called
//! "events" in the context of the Discord gateway.
//!
//! Sending a message is simple and the flow of it looks like:
//!
//! 1. If the user sends a [command] via [`Shard::command`] the command is
//! serialized into a raw websocket message and then...
//! 2. [`Shard::send`] is called and the sending of the message goes through
//! ratelimiting via [`CommandRatelimiter`] if ratelimiting [is enabled];
//! 3. The [websocket message] is sent over the [websocket connection].
//!
//! Receiving a message is a little bit more complicated, but follows as:
//!
//! 1. The user calls [`Shard::next_message`] to receive the next message from
//! the Websocket;
//! 2. If the shard is disconnected then the connection is reconnected;
//! 3. One of five things wait to happen:
//!   a. the shard receives a close frame from the user over the [user channel],
//!   which is then forwarded via [`Shard::close`]; or
//!   b. the interval for the shard to send the next heartbeat occurs, in which
//!   case [`Shard::heartbeat`] is called; or
//!   c. the background identify queue task finishes, in which case
//!   [`Shard::send`] is called with the identify payload; or
//!   d. the shard receives a command from the user over the [user channel],
//!   which is then forwarded via [`Shard::send`]; or
//!   e. the shard receives a message from Discord via the websocket connection.
//! 4. In the case of 3(a) through 3(d), 3 is repeated; otherwise...
//! 5. If the message is not a close it's [processed] by the shard;
//! 6. The raw Websocket message is returned to the user
//!
//! If the user called [`Shard::next_event`] instead of [`Shard::next_message`],
//! then the previous steps are taken and the resultant message is deserialized
//! into a [`GatewayEvent`] if it matches the user's [`EventTypeFlags`].
//!

/// Shards are responsible for maintaining the gateway connection by processing

///
/// Shards start out disconnected, but will on the first call to

/// be repeatedly called in order for the shard to maintain its connection and
/// update its internal state. Note that the [`next_event`] method internally
/// calls [`next_message`].
///
/// Shards go through an [identify queue][`queue`] that ratelimits the amount of
/// concurrent identifies (across all shards) per 5 seconds. Exceeding this
/// limit invalidates the shard's session and it is therefore very important to
/// reuse the same queue when running multiple shards. Note that shards must be
/// identified before they start receiving dispatch events and are able to send
/// [`Command`]s.
///
/// # Sharding
///
/// A shard may not be connected to more than 2500 guilds, so large bots must
/// split themselves across multiple shards. See the
/// [Discord Docs/Sharding][docs:sharding], [`ShardId`], and [`stream`]
/// documentation for more info.
///
/// # Sending shard commands in different tasks
///
/// Because shards should not be used across multiple tasks it's not always easy
/// to directly send [gateway commands] over a shard. As a convenience method,
/// [`Shard::sender`] can be used to receive an MPSC channel sender which, in
/// addition to being cheaply cloned, also only sends queued up commands when
/// the shard is identified and not ratelimited. Multiple shards' senders can,
/// for example, be collected into an `Arc<Vec<MessageSender>>` and be shared
/// across all event handler tasks.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Create and start a shard and print new and deleted messages:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::env;
/// use twilight_gateway::{Config, Event, EventTypeFlags, Intents, Shard, ShardId};
///
/// # #[tokio::main] async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
/// // Use the value of the "DISCORD_TOKEN" environment variable as the bot's
/// // token. Of course, this value may be passed into the program however is

///     .event_types(event_types)
